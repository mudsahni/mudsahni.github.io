  my aim making this website was to create a really nice aesthetically pleasing front end. i thought i'd learn how to design amazing vector graphics using adobe illustrator, and then also become really good at front end web design. as you can see, i haven't done any of that. yet. but i will. soon... let's play it by the decade... till then, this is all i can offer for a website about myself.

hello! i'm mudit. i'm a software engineer. i'm constantly trying to learn and explore subjects in more depth. be it math or computer science or physics or the metabolic impact of stuffing chocolate bars in my face everyday (??) 
<br><br>
...
<br><br>
in all seriousness, i have an obsession with learning. i've realized that one of the best emotional states one can experience is that epiphanic feeling when you <em>truly</em> understand some concept or phenomenon. in <em>any</em> field. the dots start connecting together, invisible firecrackers start bursting in your head, and for a few moments you get the feeling that you've chanced upon something which actually makes the universe tick... then you immediately rush off to force your family and friends to listen to a convoluted and confused explanation of what you so eloquently visualized in your head. that's the high point, really.
<br><br>

i am constantly looking to chase that feeling, and in that process, hopefully end up making or doing something useful.
